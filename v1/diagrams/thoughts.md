# SplitUp Strategic Specialization: Ultra-Low-Cost Verified Inference

## 1. Market Positioning & Value Proposition

SplitUp will establish a third pricing tier in the AI inference market:

| Tier               | Current Market                 | SplitUp Offering                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Real-time          | Full price, immediate response | (Not our focus)                                 |
| Standard Batch     | 50% discount, 24hr SLA         | (Not our focus)                                 |
| **Ultra-Low-Cost** | **Not established**            | **70-80% discount, +1hr SLA with verification** |

This positioning addresses a fundamental market inefficiency: LLM providers have built latency-optimized datacenters primarily for real-time inference, then offer batch discounts as a secondary service on the same infrastructure. However, batch processing doesn't require this expensive, low-latency hardware. By leveraging consumer GPUs and distributed computing where longer processing times are acceptable, we can serve this market segment at dramatically lower costs than providers who lack the incentive to build separate infrastructure optimized for non-time-sensitive workloads[^1].

## 2. Critical Assessment: Direct and Instrumental Factors

### 2.1 Direct Strengths (Core Value Propositions)

1. **Cost Advantage**: 70-80% reduction vs. standard pricing

   - Factual basis: Baseline costs for a 70B model are approximately $0.20/M tokens[^2], while market prices range from $1.00-$3.00/M tokens
   - This price differential is possible because:
     - Consumer GPUs cost 30-50% less than data center GPUs per FLOP[^3]
     - Extended processing windows (48-72h) enable 95%+ utilization vs. 80-90% for standard batch[^4]
     - Distributed execution reduces facility costs (PUE 1.1-1.2 vs. 1.5 in data centers)[^5]

2. **Market Gap**: Addressing underserved price-sensitive segments

   - Factual basis: Even with 50% batch discounts, many mid-market companies find large-scale AI processing prohibitively expensive[^6]
   - Evidence: The gap between $0.20/M (infrastructure cost) and $0.50/M (lowest batch pricing) represents untapped margin for a more efficient service

3. **Verification Capability**: Cryptographic guarantees for computation correctness
   - Factual basis: No current provider offers cryptographic verification of results
   - Value: Critical for applications where result tampering would be problematic

### 2.2 Instrumental Strengths (Enablers)

1. **Distributed Architecture**: Consumer GPU utilization

   - Enables the cost advantage but is not itself the value to customers
   - Technical implementation detail rather than direct selling point

2. **DAG-based Task Structure**: Optimized execution across distributed nodes

   - Enables efficient task routing but invisible to end users
   - Technical enabler for the promised service levels

3. **Low-Latency Optimizations**: Reduces coordination overhead
   - Enables competitive overall completion times despite distributed nature
   - Mitigates what would otherwise be a competitive disadvantage

## 3. Target Use Cases & Limitations Assessment

### 3.1 Primary Target Use Cases

1. **Bulk Embedding Generation**

   - Direct fit: Highly batchable, computationally efficient, minimal security concerns
   - Market evidence: Embedding costs show 5-10× markup across providers[^7]
   - Critical advantage: Can offer 70-80% savings with minimal downsides

2. **Non-Sensitive Document Processing**

   - Direct fit: Predictable workflows, large volumes, flexible timelines
   - Market evidence: Document processing is among the most common batch workloads[^8]
   - Critical advantage: Volume economics work in our favor for large corpora

3. **Data Enrichment for Public Content**
   - Direct fit: Background processes where lower cost enables processing entire datasets
   - Market evidence: E-commerce, media analysis, and catalog enrichment represent high-volume use cases[^9]
   - Critical advantage: Cost enables 100% processing vs. sampling approaches

### 3.2 Direct Limitations (Core Challenges)

1. **Data Confidentiality Constraints**

   - Factual issue: Data traverses nodes not under direct legal control
   - Impact: Limits applicability for sensitive information (PII, PHI, financial data)
   - Specific limitation: Legal/compliance document review would face significant barriers

   > "While SplitUp can process legal documents, the distributed nature means we cannot provide the same confidentiality guarantees as centralized providers. Data crosses multiple independent nodes without centralized legal accountability. Increased verification rates improve result integrity but do not enhance confidentiality protections."

2. **Verification Economic Limitations**

   - Factual issue: PoSP security depends on E(honest) > E(cheating)
   - Specific vulnerability: High-value outputs may incentivize collusion if rewards exceed penalties
   - Example: For a query where tampering could create $10,000 in value, an 8% verification rate with a 10× slashing penalty may be insufficient deterrent

   > "Our verification model is economically sound for standard inference but may be insufficient for outputs where tampering could yield significant economic advantage to malicious nodes. The expected penalty must exceed the potential gain from manipulation."

3. **Latency-Cost Tradeoff**

   - Factual issue: Achieving lower latency requires premium node selection and reduced batching efficiency
   - Impact: Reduces or eliminates cost advantage for faster turnaround times
   - Practical limitation: Most competitive at the 48-72h timeframe; shorter windows erode price advantage

   > "While technically capable of faster processing, prioritizing speed would sacrifice our core cost advantage. The infrastructure economics favor longer processing windows that maximize batching efficiency and node utilization."

### 3.3 Instrumental Limitations (Technical Challenges)

1. **Node Reliability Management**

   - Challenge: Consumer hardware has higher failure rates than data center equipment
   - Not directly relevant to customers if completion guarantees are maintained
   - Requires technical mitigation through redundancy and monitoring

2. **Coordination Complexity**
   - Challenge: Multi-node execution increases system complexity
   - Internal challenge rather than customer-facing limitation
   - Addressed through technical design and testing

## 4. Security & Confidentiality Framework

### 4.1 Tiered Security Model

We may have to implement a tiered security approach with multiple levels:

| Security Tier | Verification Rate    | Node Stake Requirement | Price Premium    |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Standard      | Baseline             | Base requirement       | Included         |
| Enhanced      | Moderate increase    | Higher requirement     | Moderate premium |
| Critical      | Substantial increase | Highest requirement    | Higher premium   |

This model directly addresses the economic security limitation by allowing customers to pay for stronger verification guarantees when the value of correct results warrants additional protection.

> **Important Clarification**: Higher verification rates increase result integrity assurance but do not enhance data confidentiality. Verification confirms computational correctness but doesn't prevent nodes from potentially accessing the data they process.

### 4.2 Data Handling Classification

To address confidentiality limitations, we will implement a data classification system:

| Data Class                | Description                                            | SplitUp Suitability       | Mitigation Approach                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public**                | No confidentiality requirements                        | Fully suitable            | Standard processing                                                        |
| **Business Confidential** | Competitive sensitivity but no regulatory requirements | Suitable with precautions | End-to-end encryption, node reputation system                              |
| **Regulated**             | Subject to regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) | Limited suitability       | Selective node routing to qualified operators, additional legal frameworks |
| **Highly Sensitive**      | Critical confidential information                      | Not suitable              | Recommend alternative solutions                                            |

This framework enables transparent decision-making about which workloads are appropriate for SplitUp's distributed architecture.

## 5. Comparative Market Position

### 5.1 Price-to-Value Assessment

| Provider Type                    | Pricing (70B model) | Latency             | Verification | Confidentiality |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Premium APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) | $3.00-6.00/M        | Real-time/24h batch | None         | Strong          |
| Cloud Providers (AWS, GCP)       | $1.00-2.00/M        | Real-time/24h batch | None         | Strong          |
| Open-Source Hosts                | $0.50-1.00/M        | Varies              | None         | Varies          |
| **SplitUp**                      | **$0.20-0.30/M**    | **48-72h**          | **Yes**      | **Limited**     |

This comparison clearly shows our positioning: significantly lower cost with added verification, trading off latency and some confidentiality guarantees.

### 5.2 Direct Pareto Analysis

SplitUp is not Pareto dominated by existing solutions because:

1. **vs. Cloud Batch APIs**: We offer deeper cost savings (70-80% vs. 50%) and verification, at the cost of increased latency and reduced confidentiality guarantees
2. **vs. Real-Time APIs**: We offer dramatically lower costs for tasks where latency and confidentiality are not critical

## 6. Strategic Recommendations

### 6.1 Specialization Focus

Based on this critical assessment, SplitUp should:

1. **Specialize in high-volume, non-sensitive data processing**

   - Embedding generation for public content
   - Media/catalog enrichment and analysis
   - Public document processing and summarization

   > "These use cases maximize our cost advantage while minimizing our confidentiality limitations"

2. **Develop tiered verification options**

   - Implement the proposed security tier model
   - Create clear guidelines for appropriate tier selection
   - Build monitoring to detect potential economic incentive misalignments

   > "This addresses the core economic security limitation by allowing appropriate verification levels based on output value"

3. **Create clear confidentiality guidance**

   - Develop explicit data classification guidelines
   - Build technical controls to enforce data handling policies
   - Partner with legal experts to define appropriate use boundaries

   > "Rather than claiming to solve the confidentiality challenge, we will provide transparent guidance on appropriate use cases"

### 6.2 Engineering Priorities

1. **Enhanced verification economics**

   - Implement the tiered verification system
   - Develop stake-weighted node selection
   - Create auditable verification records

   > "This directly addresses our core security limitation"

2. **Data confidentiality controls**

   - Implement end-to-end encryption for data in transit
   - Develop node reputation and compliance systems
   - Create audit mechanisms for data handling

   > "This mitigates but does not eliminate our confidentiality limitations"

3. **Utilization optimization**

   - Implement advanced batching and scheduling
   - Develop predictive resource allocation
   - Create adaptive task routing based on node capabilities

   > "This strengthens our core cost advantage"

## 7. Conclusion

SplitUp's specialization in ultra-low-cost, verification-guaranteed inference addresses a clear market gap. By focusing on appropriate use cases (non-sensitive, high-volume data processing), implementing tiered security options, and providing transparent guidance on limitations, we can deliver substantial value to price-sensitive customers while avoiding overpromising on confidentiality or security guarantees.

Our 70-80% cost advantage is technically feasible and economically sustainable, based on fundamental efficiency gains from distributed consumer hardware and extended processing windows. By acknowledging and addressing our limitations directly, we position ourselves for success in the specific market segments where our trade-offs align with customer priorities.
